Learning Airfoil Parameters
===========================

This is a tutorial to determine the aerodynamic coefficients of a given airfoil using GENN in SMT (other models could be used as well). 
The obtained surrogate model can be used to give predictions for certain Mach numbers, angles of attack and the aerodynamic coefficients. 
These calculations can be really useful in case of an airfoil shape optimization. The input parameters uses the airfoil Camber and Thickness mode shapes.

* Inputs: Airfoil Camber and Thickness mode shapes, Mach, alpha
* Outputs (options): cd, cl, cm

In this test case, we will be predicting only the Cd coefficient. However, the other databases for the prediction of the 
other terms are available in the same repository. Bouhlels mSANN uses the information contained in the paper [1]_ to determine 
the airfoil's mode shapes. Moreover, in mSANN a deep neural network is used to predict the Cd parameter of a given parametrized
airfoil. Therefore, in this tutorial, we reproduce the paper [2]_ using the Gradient-Enhanced Neural Networks (GENN) from SMT. 

Briefly explaining how mSANN generates the mode shapes of a given airfoil:

#. Using inverse distance weighting (IDW) to interpolate the surface function of each airfoil.
#. Then applying singular value decomposition (SVD) to reduce the number of variables that define the airfoil geometry. It includes a total of 14 airfoil modes (seven for camber and seven for thickness).
#. Totally 16 input variables, two flow conditions of Mach number (0.3 to 0.6) and the angle of attack (2 degrees to 6 degrees) plus 14 shape coefficients.
#. The output airfoil aerodynamic force coefficients and their respective gradients are computed using ADflow, which solves the RANS equations with a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model.
