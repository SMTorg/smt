Latin Hypercube sampling
========================

The LHS design is a statistical method for generating a quasi-random sampling distribution. It is among the most popular sampling techniques in computer experiments thanks to its simplicity and projection properties with high-dimensional problems. LHS is built as follows: we cut each dimension space, which represents a variable, into n
sections where n is the number of sampling points, and we put only one point in each section.

The LHS method uses the pyDOE package (Design of Experiments for Python) [1]_. Five criteria for the construction of LHS are implemented in SMT:

- Center the points within the sampling intervals.
- Maximize the minimum distance between points and place the point in a randomized location within its interval.
- Maximize the minimum distance between points and center the point within its interval.
- Minimize the maximum correlation coefficient.
- Optimize the design using the Enhanced Stochastic Evolutionary algorithm (ESE).

The four first criteria are the same than in pyDOE (for more details, see [1]_). The last criterion, ESE, is implemented by the authors of SMT (more details about such method could be found in [2]_).
