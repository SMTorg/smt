Latin Hypercube sampling
========================

The LHS design is a statistical method for generating a quasi-random sampling distribution. It is among the most popular sampling techniques in computer experiments thanks to its simplicity and projection properties with high-dimensional problems. LHS is built as follows: we cut each dimension space, which represents a variable, into n
sections where n is the number of sampling points, and we put only one point in each section.

The LHS method uses the pyDOE package (Design of Experiments for Python) [1]_. Five criteria for the construction of LHS are implemented in SMT:

- Center the points within the sampling intervals.
- Maximize the minimum distance between points and place the point in a randomized location within its interval.
- Maximize the minimum distance between points and center the point within its interval.
- Minimize the maximum correlation coefficient.
- Optimize the design using the Enhanced Stochastic Evolutionary algorithm (ESE).

The four first criteria are the same than in pyDOE (for more details, see [1]_). The last criterion, ESE, is implemented by the authors of SMT (more details about such method could be found in [2]_).

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
  from smt.sampling import LHS
  
  xlimits = np.array([
      [0., 4.],
      [0., 3.],
  ])
  sampling = LHS(xlimits=xlimits)
  
  num = 50
  x = sampling(num)
  
  print(x.shape)
  
  plt.plot(x[:, 0], x[:, 1], 'o')
  plt.xlabel('x')
  plt.ylabel('y')
  plt.show()
