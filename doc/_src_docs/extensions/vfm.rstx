Variable-fidelity modeling (VFM)
================================

VFM is a variable-fidelity modeling method which can use additive, multiplicative, or hybride bridge functions.
SMT proposes only additive and multiplicative options.

In the additive method, high- and low-fidelity models, :math:`y_{\text{high}}({\bf x})` and :math:`y_{\text{low}}({\bf x})`, are calibrated by adding the low-fidelity model to a function :math:`\gamma({\bf x})`, also called bridge function

.. math ::
        y_\text{high}({\bf x})=y_\text{low}({\bf x}) + \gamma({\bf x})
 
The additive bridge function was developed by Lewis and Nash [1]_.

In the same way, the multiplicative bridge function is defined by

.. math ::
        \gamma({\bf x})=\frac{y_\text{high}({\bf x})}{y_\text{low}({\bf x})}
  
However, the multiplicative bridge function may cause problems when one of the sampled values of the low-fidelity model is close to zero.

After the unknown bridge function :math:`\gamma` and low-fidelity model :math:`y_\text{low}` have been approximated with :math:`\hat{\gamma}` and :math:`\hat{y}_\text{low}`, respectively, the response of the high-fidelity model is obtained
