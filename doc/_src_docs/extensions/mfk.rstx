Multi-Fidelity Kriging (MFK)
================================

MFK is a multi-fidelity modeling method which uses an autoregressive model of order 1 (AR1).

.. math ::
        y_\text{high}({\bf x})=\rho \cdot y_\text{low}({\bf x}) + \delta({\bf x})

where :math:`\rho` is a scaling/correlation factor and :math:`\delta(\cdot)` is a discrepancy function.

The additive AR1 formulation was first introduced by Kennedy and O'Hagan [1].
The implementation here follows the one proposed by Le Gratiet [2]. It offers the advantage of being recursive and easily extended to :math:`n` level of fidelity.
