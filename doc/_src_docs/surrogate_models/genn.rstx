GENN
====

Gradient-Enhanced Neural Networks (GENN) are fully connected multi-layer perceptrons, whose training process was modified to
account for gradient information. Specifically, the parameters are learned by minimizing the Least Squares Estimator (LSE),
modified to account for partial derivatives.  The theory behind the algorithm can be found :download:`here <genn_theory.pdf>`,
but suffice it to say that the model is trained in such a way so as to minimize not only the prediction error y - f(x) of
the response, but also the prediction error dydx - f'(x) of the partial derivatives. The chief benefit of gradient-enhancement
is better accuracy with fewer training points, compared to regular neural networks without gradient-enhancement. Note that GENN applies
to regression (single-output or multi-output), but not classification since there is no gradient in that case. The implementation
is fully vectorized and uses Adam optimization, mini-batch, and L2-norm regularization.

Limitations
-----------

Gradient-enhanced methods only apply to the special use-case of computer aided design, where data is generated
synthetically using physics-based computer models, responses are continuous, and their gradient is defined. Furthermore,
gradient enhancement is only beneficial when the cost of obtaining the gradient is not excessive in the first place.
This is often true in computer-aided design with the advent of adjoint design methods for example, but it is not always
the case. The user should therefore carefully weigh the benefit of gradient-enhanced methods depending on the application.

Applications
------------

A well known use case for such methods is when there is a need to replace computationally expensive computer models with
so-called "surrogate models" in order to save time for further analysis down the line. This situation is not uncommon in
computer-aided design. In this scenario, the process consists of generating a small Design Of Experiment (DOE), running
the computationally expensive computer model for each DOE point, and using the results as training data to train a
"surrogate model" such as GENN. Since the "surrogate model" emulates the original physics-based model accurately in real
time, it offers a speed benefit that can be used to carry additional analysis such as uncertainty quantification by means
of Monte Carlo simulation, which would've been computationally inefficient otherwise.
