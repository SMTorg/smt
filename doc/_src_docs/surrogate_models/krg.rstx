Kriging
=======

Kriging is an interpolating model that is a linear combination of a known function :math:`f_i({\bf x})` which is added to a realization of a stochastic process :math:`Z({\bf x})`

.. math ::
  \hat{y} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k\beta_if_i({\bf x})+Z({\bf x}).

:math:`Z({\bf x})` is a realization of a stochastique process with mean zero and spatial covariance function given by

.. math ::
  cov\left[Z\left({\bf x}^{(i)}\right),Z\left({\bf x}^{(j)}\right)\right] =\sigma^2R\left({\bf x}^{(i)},{\bf x}^{(j)}\right)

where :math:`\sigma^2` is the process variance, and :math:`R` is the correlation.
Two types of correlation functions are available in SMT: the exponential (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) and Gaussian correlation functions

.. math ::
  \prod\limits_{l=1}^{nx}\exp\left(-\theta_l\left|x_l^{(i)}-x_l^{(j)}\right|\right),\qquad \qquad \qquad\prod\limits_{l=1}^{nx}\exp\left(-\theta_l\left(x_l^{(i)}-x_l^{(j)}\right)^{2}\right) \quad \forall\ \theta_l\in\mathbb{R}^+\\
  \text{Exponential correlation function} \quad \qquad\text{Gaussian correlation function}\qquad \qquad

These two correlation functions are called by 'abs_exp' (exponential) and 'squar_exp' (Gaussian) in SMT.

The deterministic term :math:`\sum\limits_{i=1}^k\beta_i f_i({\bf x})` can be replaced by a constant, a linear model, or a quadratic model.
These three types are available in SMT.

Kriging with mixed variables 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal is to be able to build a model for mixed variables. 
This algorithm has been presented by  Garrido-Merchán and Hernández-Lobato in 2020 [2]_.

To incorporate integer (with order relation) and categorical variables (with no order), we used continuous relaxation.
For integer, we add a continuous dimension with the same bounds and then we round in the prediction to the closer integer.
For categorical, we add as many continuous dimensions with bounds [0,1] as possible output values for the variable and then we round in the prediction to the output dimension giving the greatest continuous prediction.

Implementation Note
-------------------

The mixed variables are avalaible for all kriging models like KPLS or KPLSK but not to use with gradient.
