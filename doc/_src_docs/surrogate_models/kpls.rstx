KPLS
====

KPLS is a kriging model that uses the partial least squares (PLS) method. KPLS is faster than kriging because of the low number of hyperparameters to be estimated while maintaining a good accuracy.
This model is suitable for high-dimensional problems due to the kernel constructed through the PLS method. The PLS method [1]_ is a well known tool for high-dimensional problems that searches the direction that maximizes the variance between the input and output variables. This is done by a projection in a smaller space spanned by the so-called principal components. The PLS information are integrated into the kriging correlation matrix to scale the number of inputs by reducing the number of hyperparameters. The number of principal components  :math:`h` , which corresponds to the number of hyperparameters for KPLS and much lower than :math:`nx` (number of dimension of the problem), usually does not exceed 4 components:

.. math ::
  \prod\limits_{l=1}^{nx}\exp\left(-\theta_l\left(x_l^{(i)}-x_l^{(j)}\right)^2\right),\qquad \qquad \qquad\prod\limits_{l=1}^{nx} \prod\limits_{k=1}^h\exp\left(-\theta_k\left(w_l^{(k)}x_l^{(i)}-w_l^{(k)}x_l^{(j)}\right)^{2}\right) \quad \forall\ \theta_l,\theta_h\in\mathbb{R}^+\\
  \text{Standard Gaussian correlation function} \quad \qquad\text{PLS-Gaussian correlation function}\qquad \qquad\qquad\quad

Both absolute exponential and squared exponential kernels are available for KPLS model. More details about the KPLS approach could be found in these sources [2]_.
