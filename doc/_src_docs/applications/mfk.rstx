Multi-Fidelity Kriging (MFK)
================================

MFK is a multi-fidelity modeling method which uses an autoregressive model of order 1 (AR1).

.. math ::
        y_\text{high}({\bf x})=\rho(x) \cdot y_\text{low}({\bf x}) + \delta({\bf x})


where :math:`\rho(x)`
is a scaling/correlation factor (constant, linear or qudratic) and :math:`\delta(\cdot)` is a discrepancy function.

The additive AR1 formulation was first introduced by Kennedy and O'Hagan [1]_.
The implementation here follows the one proposed by Le Gratiet [2]_. It offers the advantage of being recursive, easily extended to :math:`n` levels of fidelity and offers better scaling for high numbers of samples.
This method only uses nested sampling training points as described by Le Gratiet [2]_.
