.. _Mixed-Integer Sampling and and Variables Types Specifications: 

Mixed-Integer usage (Variables, Sampling and Context)
=====================================================

SMT provides the ``mixed_integer`` module to adapt existing surrogates to deal with categorical (or enumerate) and ordered variables using continuous relaxation.
For ordered variables, the values are rounded to the nearest values from a provided list. If, instead, bounds are provided, the list will consist of all integers between those bounds.

The user specifies x feature types through a list of types to be either:

- ``FLOAT``: a continuous feature,
- ``ORD``: an ordered valued feature,
- or a tuple ``(ENUM, n)`` where n is the number of levels of the catagorical feature (i.e. an enumerate with n values)

In the case of mixed integer sampling, bounds of each x feature have to be adapted to take into account feature types. While ``FLOAT`` and ``ORD`` feature still have an interval [lower bound, upper bound], the ``ENUM`` features bounds is defined by giving the enumeration/list of possible values (levels). 

For instance, if we have the following ``xtypes``: ``[FLOAT, ORD, (ENUM, 2), (ENUM, 3)]``, a compatible ``xlimits`` could be ``[[0., 4], [-10, 10], ["blue", "red"], ["short", "medium",  "long"]]``.

However, the functioning of ``ORD`` is twofold. As previously mentioned, it can be used like [lower bound, upper bound], in this case [0,5] will corresponds to [0,1,2,3,4,5]. But, on the other hand, ``ORD`` can be used as an enumeration/list of possible values (levels), in this case ["0","5","6"] will corresponds to [0,5,6].


Mixed integer sampling method
-----------------------------

To use a sampling method with mixed integer typed features, the user instanciates a ``MixedIntegerSamplingMethod`` with a given sampling method.
The ``MixedIntegerSamplingMethod`` implements the ``SamplingMethod`` interface and decorates the original sampling method to provide a DOE while conforming to integer and categorical types.

Mixed integer context
---------------------

the ``MixedIntegerContext`` class helps the user to use mixed integer sampling methods and surrogate models consistently by acting as a factory for those objects given a x specification: (xtypes, xlimits).

.. _Mixed-Integer Surrogates:

Mixed integer surrogate
=======================

To use a surrogate with mixed integer constraints, the user instanciates a ``MixedIntegerSurrogateModel`` with the given surrogate.
The ``MixedIntegerSurrogateModel`` implements the ``SurrogateModel`` interface  and decorates the given surrogate while respecting integer and categorical types.
They are various surrogate models implemented that are described below.

Mixed-Integer Surrogate with Continuous Relaxation
--------------------------------------------------

For enum variables, as many x features are added as there is enumerated levels for the variables. These new dimensions have [0, 1] bounds and the max of these feature float values will correspond to the choice of one the enum value: this is the so-called "one-hot encoding".
For instance, for a categorical variable (one feature of x) with three levels ["blue", "red", "green"], 3 continuous float features x0, x1, x2 are created. Thereafter, the value max(x0, x1, x2), for instance, x1, will give "red" as the value for the original categorical feature. Details can be found in [1]_ .

Mixed-Integer Surrogate with Gower Distance
-------------------------------------------

Another implemented method is using a basic mixed integer kernel based on the Gower distance between two points.
When constructing the correlation kernel, the distance is redefined as :math:`\Delta= \Delta_{cont} + \Delta_{cat}`, with :math:`\Delta_{cont}` the continuous distance as usual and :math:`\Delta_ {cat}` the categorical distance defined as the number of categorical variables that differs from one point to another.

For example, the Gower Distance between ``[1,'red', 'medium']`` and ``[1.2,'red', 'large']`` is :math:`\Delta= 0.2+ (0` ``'red'`` :math:`=` ``'red'`` :math:`+ 1` ``'medium'`` :math:`\neq` ``'large'``  ) :math:`=1.2`.
With this distance, a mixed integer kernel can be build. Details can be found in [1]_ .

Mixed-Integer Surrogate with Group Kernel (Homoscedastic Hypersphere)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This surrogate model consider that the correlation kernel between the levels of a given variable is a symmetric positive definite matrix. The latter matrix is estimated through an hypersphere parametrization depending on several hyperparameters. To finish with, the data correlation matrix is build as the product of the correlation matrices over the various variables. Details can be found in [1]_ . Note that this model is the only one to consider negative correlations between levels ("blue" can be correlated negatively to "red").

Mixed-Integer Surrogate with Exponential Homoscedastic Hypersphere
------------------------------------------------------------------

This surrogate model also consider that the correlation kernel between the levels of a given variable is a symmetric positive definite matrix. The latter matrix is estimated through an hypersphere parametrization depending on several hyperparameters. Thereafter, an exponential kernel is applied to the matrix. To finish with, the data correlation matrix is build as the product of the correlation matrices over the various variables. Therefore, this model could not model negative correlation and only works with absolute exponential and Gaussian kernels. Details can be found in [1]_ .
