Cooperative Components Kriging (CoopCompKRG)
================================

Cooperative Components Kriging is a way of fitting a high-dimensional ordinary Kriging model by sequential lower-dimensional component model fits. For each component, only the associated hyperparameters are optimized. All other hyperparameters are set to a so-called cooperative context vector, which contains the current best hyperparameter values.

This application contains the single component model fits. The loop over the components has to be implemented individually, as shown in the usage example below.

The cooperative components model fit was developed as part of a high-dimensional surrogate-based optimization process. It is inspired by distributed multi-disciplinary design optimization (MDO) approaches and the cooperative EGO by Zhan et al. [1]_.
